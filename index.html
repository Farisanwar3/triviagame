		<p>Title: The Slimey Trivia High Concept: Take this trivia to create your own story about how you would deal with the lunch demon, slime, soggy sandwich, and the slug.
<p>Player Experience Goals: Bring storytelling elements into a trivia and experience the story as you answer questions
Once you play this game, you will become addicted to it.  
<p>Strategies: Just joke around when answering the questions
There is no correct answer to every single question.
Keep yourself relaxed as you answer more questions
<p>Genre: Puzzle, Trivia
<p>Game play: use buttons to select the answers
<p>Target Audience: This game is for people who love funny things and literature in general 
For people over the age of 10.
<p>Prototype: This game is inspired by the interview simulation games
Instead of an interview, the game is a test with multiple choice questions.
I wanted to do a minimalistic design that involved storytelling elements in a test game.
<p>Setting/Premise: You take this test wherever and whenever you want
<p>Story: There are many moral agents which look weird. You must decide what you think about them.   
<p>Prototype Assets: From Google images.  
Used ideas from brainstorming activity done last week.
Used my imagination for many of the questions.
Used many puns and made parodies of real life things. 
<p>Prototype Closest Other Game: One of the interview simulation games.
